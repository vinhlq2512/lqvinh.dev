As a passionate Fullstack Developer at CMC Global, I specialize in .NET Core, SQL optimization, and modern frontend technologies such as Blazor and Next.js. I enjoy building scalable, high-performance web systems that deliver real value to users and businesses.

Currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, I continuously explore advanced technologies to enhance both backend architecture and user experience. My goal is to become a versatile engineer capable of bridging system efficiency with creative frontend solutions.
